# HTML-CSS-TRAINING

Heya this is a project that used SuperSimpleDev's HTML CSS Course for Beginners that walked me through the process of making a pseudo-YouTube that I managed to program using only CSS and HTML.

## I've managed to understand all of the basics of CSS AND HTML which are shown in the project itself:

- Basic CSS AND HTML properties
- Hovers, Transitions, Shadows
- Chrome DevTools & CSS Box Model
- Text Styles & The HTML Structure
- Images and Text Boxes
- CSS Display Property & The div Element
- Nested Layouts Technique
- CSS Grid, Flexbox, Nested Flexbox
- CSS Position, Position Absolute and Relative
- And some more CSS Features like @media

### As a first ever project in CSS AND HTML, that shows all the basics for the languages I think it turned out great.
